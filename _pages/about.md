I am PhD Economics Student at UC Berkeley in first year. I am broadly interested in Public Finance, Macroeconomics, Industrial Organization and State Capacity. In my ongoing work, I study profit shifting and impact anti tax avoidance rules using tax data from Uganda. I also study role of size based tax policies in firm growth and productivity and misallocation using tax data from Pakistan. 

I worked as predoc in economics at Columbia University for professors [Michael Best](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/mcb2270/) and [Jack J. Willis](https://sites.google.com/view/jwillis/). I completed my masters in economics from University of Manchester, where I was advised by [Mazhar Waseem](www.mazharwaseem.com)
